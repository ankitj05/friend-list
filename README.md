# Friend List Application.

## Features
1. ### Text Box
    Used to enter the friend's name. 
    Will also act as a search bar for the name, if not found, will show a prompt to add that friend to your list. You can choose to either add or ignore.

2. ### Favorite
    You can mark your friend as favorite or maybe unmark them if they didn't share their beer with you.

3. ### Delete
    If you and your "friend" got into a fight, you can always remove them from your friend list. Ofcourse once you are done fighting. 

4. ### Sort By Favorite
    Hey, if you are not able to find all your favorite friends, you can always sort by favourite, so that they remain at the top of your list. 
    (Goes back to page 1, when you sort.)

5. ### Pagination
    At once you can only see 4 of your friends, so to see more friends go to other pages.
