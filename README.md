# Friend List Application.

## Features

1. Text Box
    Used to enter the friend's name. 
    Will search for the name, if not found, will show a prompt to add that friend to your list.

2. Favorite
    You can mark your friend as favorite or maybe your friend didn't share his/her beer and now he/she is not your favorite friend.

3. Delete
    If you and your "friend" get into fight, you can always remove them from your friend list. 

4. Sort By Favorite
    Hey, if you are not able to find all your favorite friends, you can always sort by favourite, so that they remain at the top of your list. 

5. Pagination
    At once you can only see 4 of your friends, so to see more friends go to other pages.


## React/JS concepts implemented

1. Hooks- useState, useContext, useReducer, useEffect
2. debouncing - using search bar, no need to search for friend on every key press, just search after a delay of few seconds.
3. passing props
4. Conditional Rendering
